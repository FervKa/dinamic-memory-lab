# dinamic-memory-lab


In the “src” folder, we will create the files with the solution with the point of the “Task_1_Dynamic_Memory_Management.ipynb”.



In the file “.env”, we will have to write the variables called with our names and, the value for this one will be the ID.



# Branches

Each one must create a branch with the format first_name_surname, for example: stiven_suarez, and work on it.

The changes you make should be uploaded to your branch, and if you can, make the pull request to the non_prod branch.


# Solutions and testing

All the solutions and proposed cases are in "main.py", we unify all the answers for quick access.

The explanations of the codes are in each solution file in the last lines. They are commented.



For the time being, that's all!


Happy programming.
